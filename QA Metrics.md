This is a list of common parameters to track to understand the team's effectiveness in identifying defects, ensuring product quality, and optimizing testing processes.

### Common Metrics for Manual Testing

1. **Defect Density:** Measures the number of defects found in a software module relative to its size, usually calculated per thousand lines of code (KLOC) or function points. Follow the trend rather than absolute numbers.
2. **Bug Leakage:** Measures the number of defects missed during testing but caught by end-users. Lower bug leakage indicates more effective testing.
3. **Test Case Coverage:** Assesses the extent to which the software is tested. It evaluates the amount of functional requirements covered by the executed test cases.
4. **Time to Test:** Tracks the average time taken to design, prepare, and execute test cases. Efficiency in this metric often correlates with experience and skill.
5. **Defect distribution:** Defects classified by severity and  priority can help tune test strategy.

Here are some metrics that can help evaluate automation testing efforts: 
1. **Bugs caught through automation**: The count and quality of bugs helps determine value that test automation brings to teams.
2. **Bugs missed through automation**: Helps determint the direction in which automation should progress.
3. **Automated Test Coverage**: Similar to test case coverage in manual testing, this metric measures the extent of the application tested by automated scripts versus the total application functionality.
4. **Automation Percentage**: Measures the proportion of test cases automated versus the total number of test cases. The trend over multiple sprints can help plan long term strategy for QA.
5. **Execution Speed and Stability**: Assesses how quickly automated tests run and their pass/fail consistency over multiple executions. Stability and speed are important factors in setting up an effective CI/CD pipeline.
6. **Script Maintainability**: Indicates how easily test scripts can be updated in response to changes in the application or environment.
