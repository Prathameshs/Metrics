This is a list of common parameters to track to understand the team's effectiveness in identifying defects, ensuring product quality, and optimizing testing processes.

### Common Metrics for Manual Testing

1. **Defect Density**: Measures the number of defects found in a software module relative to its size, usually calculated per thousand lines of code (KLOC) or function points. Follow the trend rather than absolute numbers.
2. **Bug Leakage**: Measures the number of defects missed during testing but caught by end-users. Lower bug leakage indicates more effective testing.
3. **Test Execution Completion Rate**: Tracks the percentage of test cases executed against the planned test cases. This metric is essential for monitoring the progress of testing activities.
4. **Test Case Coverage**: Assesses the extent to which the software is tested. It evaluates the amount of functional requirements covered by the executed test cases.
5. **Bug Leakage**: Measures the number of defects missed during testing but caught by end-users. Lower bug leakage indicates more effective testing.
6. **Time to Test**: Tracks the average time taken to design, prepare, and execute test cases. Efficiency in this metric often correlates with experience and skill.
